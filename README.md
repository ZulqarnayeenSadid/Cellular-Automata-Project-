# Cellular-Automata-Group-Project
This software engineering project aims to understand how apparent complexity and unpredictability can arise over time from extremely simple rules and limited states, the limits of computation and whether some problems can only be solved by running a complete simulation, natural patterns, and the P vs. NP problem in theoretical computer science.
